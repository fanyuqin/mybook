# 5.4.1 NFT(Non-Fungible Token)

In the AQUANEE game, players can breed and evolve their NFT, turning the NFT into assets that can be traded on the market.

If a player creates or owns the original AQUAs, they can evolve 2 original AQUAs into a new AQUA. The AQUAs can be sold as game assets. In the game, NEE dropped during the game will also become the only supply of AQUA (NFT) for reproduction and game evolution. In AQUANEE, there is a NFT evolution cost rule. Two AQUAs can evolve into a new more advanced AQUA.

Evolutionary path: Ocean AQUA 一 Land AQUA 一 Sky AQUA 一 Universe AQUA.

Every time the AQUAs evolve, the current level will be consumed and minted to the new more advanced NFT. In the game, players will own a new AQUA. This rule will create scarcity of AQUA and make the NFT collection more valuable.
