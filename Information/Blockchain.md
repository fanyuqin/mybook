In the beginning, AQUANEE will be developed on Ethereum to ensure the stability and quick participation of players. After the ecosystem is built, the community will vote to use the AQUANEE public chain to ensure that we can provide the blockchain network with seamless game experiences, fast transactions, and data storage functions.

AQUANEE strives to become the practitioner of decentralized games and further enhance and promote the seamless, cost-effective, and user-friendly game experience of the traditional blockchain.

We will bring AQDC tokens with multi-chain support and in-game NFT (assets).
