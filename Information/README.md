# 5. Project Token Information

AQUANEE is the first to take the ocean as the starting point of the world themed "'Pokemon Inspired" SLG blockchain game. AQUAs are minted into NFTs. In the game, players can collect AQUAs and other NFT assets. There will be functions like trading, renting, and auctioning. In the liquid assets of the game, the combination of blockchain technologies, NFT, and GameFi functions will greatly promote the positive development of the game's ecosystem.

Blockchain's decentralization feature also makes DAO possible within the game's ecosystem. It is an interesting feature for the players and investors. Also, the time and effort they pay into this game will become valuable, making "Play to Earn" possible.
