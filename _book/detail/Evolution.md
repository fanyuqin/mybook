# 3.4.2 Reproduction & Evolution

AQUAs can create new offspring by reproduction. The offspring can be used for combat, breeding new offspring, or being sold on our marketplace.

To manage the AQUA herd, reproduction requires a certain number of resources and each AQUA has a limit to the number of times it can be bred. The resources consumed will increase as you reproduce more.

Users can spend a certain amount of AQDC to buy fish eggs. After 7 days of incubation, fish eggs will grow into AQUAs. Newborn AQUAs can join battle immediately.

Newborn AQUAs can become mature AQUAs 3 days after they are born. Two mature AQUAs can reproduce new AQUAs and the new AQUAs reproduced will randomly inherit features like attributes and skins from the last generation of AQUAs. When players own two AQUAs or more, they can use those AQUAs to reproduce. When players own only one AQUA or want it to possess the AQUA attributes it does not have yet, Buy AQUAs in the market and breed them and create AQUAs with new attributes. A mature AQUA can reproduce once every 1 days.

The game is currently separated into 4 civilization levels: Ocean, Land, Sky, and Universe. The 4 civilization levels correspond to the AQUAs of the four civilizations. Using two AQUAs of the same phase can evolve them into the next phase. After reaching the next phase, AQUA's attributes will increase. There is no evolution after the AQUA reaches to Universe Phase. Note: After the evolution, the original NFTs that participated in the evolution will disappear permanently.

AQUAs are separated into four Civilizations, including the Ocean Civilization, Land Civilization, Sky Civilization, and Universe Civilization.

Before the AQUA evolves to the cosmic stage, two AQUAs in the same civilization stage can evolve into higher AQUAs in the next stage. The AQUA attribute of entering the new civilization will be comprehensively improved. Each evolution needs to consume NEE Force Stone. With the improvement of the evolution stage, the number of NEE Force Stone required for evolution will increase.

Each new civilization stage will explore different world tasks. The higher the civilization task, the more opportunities for the output of the NEE Force Stone will be obtained.
