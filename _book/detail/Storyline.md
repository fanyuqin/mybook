Hidden within the deep expanse of the universe, there's a peaceful planet named AQUANEE. Beautiful oceans cover almost all of AQUANEE's surface. AQUANEE is home to intelligent creatures called AQUAs. AQUAs have a unique religion centered around the Sun God, the creator of their world and civilization. Over time, AQUAs have
evolved technologically in both infrastructure and advanced weapons. And through collecting resources, fighting invaders, and reproducing, AQUAs build a more robust culture unmatched by nearby worlds.

Pleased with his work, the Sun God blessed AQUANEE again by starting the AQUAs self-awakening. Their resource collection and demonstration of strength have led them to search for legendary temples and shrines to honor the Sun God. Shrines, made to reflect the image and glory of the Sun God, were enriched with silver, bronze, and ivory. Hidden within some, AQUAs began to discover the God of the Sun's energy scepter.

After acquiring the energy of the scepter of the God of the Sun, the energy system inside Sun Temple can be accessed. The center of the energy system is the NEE Force Stone, a gigantic crystal that absorbs and converts sunlight into energy. The sun's energy is collected, enhanced, turned into invisible resource rays, and sent out into the ether.

However, Supremus, an ancient monster who passed through a time fissure, destroyed the NEE Force Stone. All the concentrated energy in the NEE Force Stone was released, causing AQUANEE's spiritual world to collapse. Some AQUAs became spiritual slaves of Supremus and turned dark .To fight against Supremus the brave AQUA heroes followed the guidance of the Elder Scroll. The scroll guided them to search for NEE Force shards. By collecting these NEE Force shards, AQUAs may have a chance to defeat Supremus.
