# 5.4.5.1 Management

* **DAO Virtual World**

AQUANEE is a decentralized game managed by the community. In this sense, AQUANEE is a decentralized autonomous organization (with DAO as the core). Players have the right to propose, vote, and ultimately decide how the game will be developed in the future. Such management includes but is not limited to game development, game items, reward system, stake system, and more.

* **Complete Decentralization**

The owners of AQDC Tokens are allowed to participate in the management of AQUANEE, including making suggestions and voting regarding the game development. AQDC Token owners who hold but do not pledge their tokens are only allowed to vote on development suggestions proposed by others. They have the right to vote but they cannot make suggestions.

* **DAO Procedures:**

Pledge: AQDC owners can create their DAO agreements on the platform and lend their AQDC to others.

* **DAO Proposals:**

The proposals created will be inspected by the team for their validity, possibility, and development advantages.
The proposals passed will be played and listed on the proposal advertisement board. Other players can vote for them in the game.

* **Rewards :**

The proposals that receive enough votes will be implemented and the proposers will be rewarded accordingly.

The voters may receive the rewards they distributed (if available).

* **Implementation:**

The winning proposals that require development will be handled outside AQUANEE's main development.
