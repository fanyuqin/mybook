Players will start developing in a random water world zone. Before the game begins, each player will start their journey with a special water creature--AQUA (NFT). Players need 2-5 AQUAs to form a combat team, explore the unknown world, defeat enemies, and win world resources.

When exploring a certain area, different random events may be triggered. Players can obtain resource rewards for the corresponding difficulty after completing the unexpected events. Players can obtain more powerful AQUA through breeding, evolution, market purchase, etc., complete emergencies with the greatest possible chance, and win more rewards.
