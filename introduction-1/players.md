# 2.2 Target Players

AQUANEEs target players can be casual players, professional players, and players that collect NFT collectibles. Our game allows players to collect different AQUAs and battle up to 5 AQUAs at once. Players will receive NEE tokens and other resource items during battles. With the tokens and resource items, players can create new AQUAs by breeding or evolving them. The tokens and resource items can also be used for purchasing survival materials or be sold in the market.
